# Leechstone

A new ore found deep in caves with the unique ability to apply weakness to hostile mobs on a critical hit when wearing the armor. More armor = longer weakness. On top of this, craft a sword or axe to yield yourself a full heart of health from critcal hitting a hostile mob. While challenging to find, being the same tier as diamond but with added durabiliy makes it worth the effort!

This mod is a work in progress so don't expect many updates as I finish the school year and work on other small projects. Thank you for your patience :)
